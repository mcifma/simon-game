Game title: SIMON

Simon is an incredibly fun memory game. It involves 4 colors usually yellow, blue, red, green, the player is shown a pattern of colors, starting from one pattern and it usually continues to for a few more rounds up to 10 or 20 rounds. 
Your mission if you choose to accept it is to conquer SIMON and its tricky pattern of colors.
